# Feature Specification: Schedule Filtering

**Feature Branch**: `001-schedule-filtering`
**Created**: 2025-01-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I would like to add filtering in the schedule page"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Filter Tasks by Status (Priority: P1)

As a user managing my schedule, I want to filter tasks by their completion status so I can focus on specific types of work (e.g., only pending tasks, only completed tasks, or all tasks).

**Why this priority**: This is the most fundamental filtering capability that immediately reduces visual clutter and helps users focus on relevant work.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by applying status filters and verifying only tasks with matching status appear in the schedule view.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing the schedule page with multiple tasks, **When** I select "Pending Only" filter, **Then** only tasks with "pending" status are displayed in the schedule
2. **Given** I have the "Completed Only" filter applied, **When** I select "All Tasks" filter, **Then** both pending and completed tasks appear in the schedule
3. **Given** I have tasks with different statuses, **When** I toggle between "Pending Only", "Completed Only", and "All Tasks", **Then** the schedule updates immediately to show only tasks matching the selected status

### User Story 2 - Filter Tasks by Priority Level (Priority: P2)

As a user with multiple competing priorities, I want to filter tasks by their priority level so I can focus on high-priority items or see all items regardless of priority.

**Why this priority**: Priority filtering helps users focus on urgent or important tasks when time is limited, which is a common use case for task management.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by applying priority filters and verifying only tasks with matching priority levels appear in the schedule view.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing the schedule page, **When** I select "High Priority Only" filter, **Then** only tasks marked as high priority appear in the schedule
2. **Given** I have the "High Priority Only" filter applied, **When** I select "All Priorities" filter, **Then** tasks of all priority levels (high, medium, low) appear in the schedule
3. **Given** I select "Medium and High Priority" filter, **Then** only medium and high priority tasks appear, excluding low priority tasks

---

### User Story 3 - Filter Tasks by Date Range (Priority: P2)

As a user planning my work, I want to filter tasks by specific date ranges so I can focus on tasks within a particular timeframe (today, this week, this month, or custom dates).

**Why this priority**: Date range filtering helps users focus on immediate concerns or plan for specific periods, which is essential for effective time management.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting different date range presets and custom date ranges, verifying only tasks within those date ranges appear in the schedule.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing the monthly schedule, **When** I select "Today Only" filter, **Then** only tasks scheduled for today appear in the view
2. **Given** I select "This Week" filter, **When** viewing the schedule, **Then** only tasks within the current week are displayed
3. **Given** I apply a custom date range filter, **When** I select start and end dates, **Then** only tasks between those dates (inclusive) appear in the schedule

---

### User Story 4 - Filter Tasks by Category/Tags (Priority: P3)

As a user organizing work across different projects or areas, I want to filter tasks by categories or tags so I can focus on specific project work or areas of responsibility.

**Why this priority**: Category filtering helps users with complex, multi-project workloads maintain context and focus, but it's less critical than basic status and priority filtering.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting different category filters and verifying only tasks with matching categories appear in the schedule.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have tasks across multiple categories, **When** I select a specific category filter, **Then** only tasks belonging to that category appear in the schedule
2. **Given** I have "Work" category selected, **When** I also select "Personal" category (multi-select), **Then** both work and personal tasks appear in the schedule
3. **Given** I have category filters applied, **When** I select "All Categories", **Then** tasks from all categories appear in the schedule

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a filter combination results in no tasks matching? The schedule should show a clear "No tasks found" message with the option to clear filters.
- How does system handle tasks with missing filter attributes (e.g., tasks without priority or category)? These tasks should be shown unless explicitly filtered out, or grouped under "Unassigned" category.
- What happens when user navigates away from schedule page and returns? Filter preferences should persist for the session.
- How does system handle invalid date ranges (end date before start date)? System should show validation error and prevent filter application.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide status filtering options: "All Tasks", "Pending Only", "Completed Only"
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide priority filtering options: "All Priorities", "High Only", "High + Medium", "Medium Only", "Low Only"
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide date range filtering with presets: "Today", "This Week", "This Month", "Custom Range"
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide category/tag filtering with multi-select capability if categories exist
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to combine multiple filter types simultaneously (e.g., status + priority + date range)
- **FR-006**: System MUST display number of tasks currently showing vs total tasks (e.g., "Showing 5 of 12 tasks")
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a "Clear All Filters" option to reset to default view
- **FR-008**: Filter controls MUST be clearly visible and accessible on the schedule page
- **FR-009**: Schedule view MUST update immediately when filters are applied or changed
- **FR-010**: System MUST show appropriate message when no tasks match current filter criteria

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Task Filter**: Represents current filter state with attributes for status, priority, date range, and categories
- **Filter Criteria**: Individual filter components (status filter, priority filter, date range filter, category filter)
- **Schedule View**: The calendar/timeline display that adapts based on applied filters

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can find and focus on relevant tasks 50% faster using filters vs. scanning all tasks
- **SC-002**: 90% of users can successfully apply and combine filters within 30 seconds of first use
- **SC-003**: Schedule page loads and applies filters within 2 seconds, even with 1000+ tasks
- **SC-004**: User satisfaction with schedule usability improves by 40% based on feedback surveys
