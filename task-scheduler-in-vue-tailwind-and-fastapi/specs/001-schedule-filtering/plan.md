# Implementation Plan: Schedule Filtering

**Branch**: `001-schedule-filtering` | **Date**: 2025-01-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-schedule-filtering/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This feature adds comprehensive filtering capabilities to the schedule page, allowing users to filter tasks by status, priority, date range, and categories. Based on database analysis, this requires schema enhancements to add priority and category fields, along with frontend UI components for filter selection and backend API endpoints for filtered data retrieval.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.10+ (Backend), JavaScript (Frontend)
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy ORM, Alembic (Backend); Vue.js 3, Pinia, Tailwind CSS, Dayjs (Frontend)
**Storage**: PostgreSQL database (Docker container)
**Testing**: pytest (Backend), Vitest/Playwright (Frontend)
**Target Platform**: Web application running in Docker containers
**Project Type**: Web application (backend + frontend)
**Performance Goals**: <2 second filter response time, support 1000+ concurrent users
**Constraints**: Must maintain CORS-free architecture via Nginx reverse proxy
**Scale/Scope**: Support task lists with 1000+ tasks per user

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Database-Aware Development ✓
- **Before**: Current task table analyzed, identified missing priority and category fields
- **After**: Complete data model designed with PriorityEnum, tags array, and strategic indexes
- **Implementation**: Alembic migration script created with proper enum types and performance indexes
- **Complexity Justified**: Schema enhancement required for filtering functionality; no simpler alternative provides needed capabilities

### Docker-First Testing ✓
- **Before**: Planned testing approach identified
- **After**: Test structure defined in quickstart guide with pytest backend and Vitest/Playwright frontend
- **Implementation**: All filter functionality will be tested in Docker containers
- **Complexity**: No additional complexity introduced

### Test-Driven Development ✓
- **Before**: Red-Green-Refactor commitment established
- **After**: Detailed testing strategy outlined including unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests
- **Implementation**: Testing patterns defined for filter validation, API endpoints, and UI components
- **Complexity**: No additional complexity introduced

### CORS-Free Architecture ✓
- **Before**: Relative URL pattern identified
- **After**: API contract defined with `/api/tasks` endpoint using query parameters
- **Implementation**: Nginx reverse proxy will route filter requests without CORS issues
- **Complexity**: No additional complexity introduced

### Full-Stack Consistency ✓
- **Before**: Technology stack alignment confirmed
- **After**: Complete implementation plan maintains FastAPI + Vue.js + Tailwind CSS consistency
- **Implementation**: Pydantic schemas match Vue component models; Pinia store manages filter state
- **Complexity**: No additional complexity introduced

## Re-evaluation Summary

**All Constitution Principles PASSED ✓**

- **No violations detected**: All design decisions align with constitution principles
- **No unjustified complexity**: Schema enhancement is necessary and minimal for filtering requirements
- **No technology divergence**: Implementation maintains established FastAPI + Vue.js stack
- **Ready for implementation**: Phase 2 can proceed with `/speckit.tasks` command
