# Tasks: Schedule Filtering

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-schedule-filtering/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are included following TDD approach specified in the constitution

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Backend**: `backend/` (FastAPI application)
- **Frontend**: `client/src/` (Vue.js application)
- **Tests**: `backend/tests/`, `client/tests/`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Verify Docker development environment is running
- [x] T002 [P] Check current task database schema in backend/models/task.py
- [x] T003 [P] Backup existing data before schema changes

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T004 Create Alembic migration for priority and tags fields in backend/alembic/versions/
- [x] T005 [P] Add PriorityEnum to backend/tasks/model.py
- [x] T006 [P] Create TaskFilterParams schema in backend/tasks/filter_schema.py
- [x] T007 [P] Create filter validation in backend/tasks/validators.py
- [x] T008 [P] Setup filter service functions in backend/tasks/services.py
- [x] T009 [P] Create enhanced TaskResponse schema in backend/tasks/schema.py
- [x] T010 Update Task model with new fields in backend/tasks/model.py
- [x] T011 [P] Create Pinia task store structure in client/src/stores/taskStore.js
- [x] T012 [P] Create TaskFilters Vue component structure in client/src/components/TaskFilters.vue

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - Status Filtering)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2 - Priority Filtering)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2 - Date Range Filtering)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P3 - Tag Filtering)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2/US3 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD approach)
- Backend services before frontend components
- Filter logic before UI components
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Backend and frontend tasks within different stories can run in parallel
- Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel after all stories complete

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (TDD approach):
Task: "T013 [P] [US1] Create status filter integration test in backend/tests/integration/test_status_filter.py"
Task: "T014 [P] [US1] Create status filter API contract test in backend/tests/contract/test_status_filter.py"
Task: "T015 [P] [US1] Create status filter frontend test in client/tests/components/TaskFilters.spec.js"

# Launch backend implementation tasks for User Story 1:
Task: "T016 [US1] Implement status filtering in get_filtered_tasks service in backend/tasks/services.py"
Task: "T017 [US1] Add status filter parameter support in backend/tasks/router.py"

# Launch frontend implementation tasks for User Story 1:
Task: "T018 [US1] Create status filter UI controls in client/src/components/TaskFilters.vue"
Task: "T019 [US1] Implement status filter state management in client/src/stores/taskStore.js"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Status Filtering)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Status Filtering) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 (Priority Filtering) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 (Date Range Filtering) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 (Tag Filtering) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns ‚Üí Final optimization
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Status Filtering)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Priority Filtering)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Date Range Filtering)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Tag Filtering)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Team works together on Polish phase

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Follow TDD: Write tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All filter features must maintain <2 second response time performance requirement
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
