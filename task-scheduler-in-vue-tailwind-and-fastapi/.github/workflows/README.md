## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
1. GitHub repository with appropriate secrets configured
2. Docker and Docker Compose setup for E2E tests
3. Proper test structure following the existing patterns

### Required Secrets

Configure these repository secrets in GitHub Settings:

```yaml
# Security scanning
SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN: "your-semgrep-token"
SNYK_TOKEN: "your-snyk-token"
LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN: "your-lighthouse-ci-token"

# Optional: Custom integrations
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: "your-slack-webhook"
TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL: "your-teams-webhook"
```

### Environment Variables

Workflows use these environment variables:

```yaml
PYTHON_VERSION: "3.10"
NODE_VERSION: "20"
POSTGRES_VERSION: "15"
```

## ðŸ“Š Test Structure

### Backend Tests
```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ unit/           # Unit tests (fast, isolated)
â”œâ”€â”€ integration/    # Integration tests (database required)
â”œâ”€â”€ e2e/           # End-to-end tests (full stack)
â””â”€â”€ conftest.py    # pytest configuration
```

### Frontend Tests
```
client/tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ unit/          # Unit tests for components and utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ e2e/           # Playwright end-to-end tests
â””â”€â”€ components/    # Component-specific tests
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Triggering Workflows

### Automatic Triggers
- **Push to main/develop**: All workflows run
- **Pull Request**: All workflows except deployment
- **Schedule**: Security scans weekly, E2E tests daily

### Manual Triggers
- **Workflow Dispatch**: Manual execution from GitHub Actions tab
- **API**: Programmatically trigger workflows

### Selective Execution
Use path filters to run workflows only when relevant files change:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'backend/**'      # Triggers backend workflows
      - 'client/**'       # Triggers frontend workflows
      - 'docker compose.yaml'  # Triggers E2E workflows
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance and Optimization

### Parallel Execution
- Matrix jobs run in parallel across environments
- Browser tests run independently
- Security scans operate concurrently

### Caching
- npm dependencies cached by package-lock.json
- pip dependencies cached by requirements.txt
- Docker layers cached for faster builds
- Playwright browsers cached between runs

### Resource Management
- Jobs have appropriate timeout values
- Fail-fast disabled for matrix testing
- Conditional execution to save resources

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### Database Testing
PostgreSQL service configured for testing:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    env:
      POSTGRES_USER: scheduler
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: scheduler
      POSTGRES_DB: scheduler_test
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "pg_isready", "-U", "scheduler"]
```

### Browser Testing
Playwright configuration supports:

```yaml
projects:
  - name: chromium
  - name: firefox
  - name: webkit
  - name: Mobile Chrome
  - name: Mobile Safari
```

## ðŸ“‹ Test Results and Artifacts

### Available Artifacts
- `backend-test-results`: pytest results and coverage
- `frontend-test-results`: Vitest results and coverage
- `e2e-results-{browser}`: Playwright test results
- `security-scan-results`: Security vulnerability reports
- `code-quality-results`: Linting and quality metrics
- `test-analytics-report`: Aggregated test analytics

### Coverage Reports
- Backend: HTML coverage report in `htmlcov/`
- Frontend: Coverage in `client/coverage/`
- Combined coverage uploaded to Codecov

### Test Analytics
- Interactive dashboard at `/test-analytics/`
- Historical trend analysis
- Performance metrics over time

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Docker Compose Timeouts**
   - Increase health check timeouts
   - Check service logs in workflow run
   - Verify database connection strings

2. **Playwright Browser Installation**
   - Browsers cached between runs
   - Use `npx playwright install-deps` for system dependencies

3. **PostgreSQL Connection Issues**
   - Ensure health checks pass
   - Verify database credentials
   - Check for port conflicts

4. **npm Audit Failures**
   - Review audit report for severity
   - Update dependencies as needed
   - Use `--audit-level` to adjust sensitivity

### Debugging Tips

1. **Enable Debug Logging**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Debug step
     run: |
       set -x  # Enable command tracing
       your-command-here
   ```

2. **Download Artifacts Locally**:
   ```bash
   gh run download RUN_ID
   ```

3. **Test Locally**:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   docker compose up -d
   pytest tests/

   # Frontend
   cd client && npm test

   # E2E
   npx playwright test
   ```

## ðŸ“š Best Practices

1. **Test Organization**:
   - Keep tests focused and independent
   - Use descriptive test names
   - Group related tests logically

2. **Performance**:
   - Use appropriate test timeouts
   - Cache dependencies effectively
   - Run only necessary tests on PR

3. **Security**:
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Monitor security scan results
   - Fix high-priority vulnerabilities promptly

4. **Quality**:
   - Maintain high code coverage
   - Address quality gate failures
   - Review test analytics regularly

## ðŸ”„ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Update GitHub Actions versions monthly
- Review and update dependency versions
- Monitor workflow performance and costs
- Archive old test artifacts

### Scaling Considerations
- Add more matrix combinations as needed
- Implement test result caching for large suites
- Consider self-hosted runners for specific needs
- Optimize Docker image sizes and build times

## ðŸ“ž Support

For issues with the CI/CD pipeline:

1. Check workflow run logs for detailed error messages
2. Review this documentation for configuration guidance
3. Consult individual workflow files for specific implementation details
