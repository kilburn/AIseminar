# Feature Specification: TweetEval-based Interactive NLP Analysis Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-tweeteval-nlp-platform`
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a FastAPI + Vue stack backed by PostgreSQL and Qdrant to power TweetEvalâ€‘based interactive NLP analysis with semantic search and visualizations."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Tweet Dataset Upload & Processing (Priority: P1)

Researchers and data scientists can upload tweet datasets (CSV/JSON) and have them automatically processed through TweetEval models for sentiment analysis, emotion classification, and offensive language detection.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality that enables all downstream analysis - without processed data, no visualizations or search can be performed.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading a sample CSV file with 10 tweets and verifying that all TweetEval classifications are generated and stored correctly in the database.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I'm on the upload page with a valid CSV file containing tweets, **When** I upload the file, **Then** the system processes each tweet through TweetEval models and stores results in PostgreSQL with embeddings in Qdrant.
2. **Given** I upload a file with invalid format, **When** I submit the upload, **Then** I receive clear error messages explaining the required format.
3. **Given** I upload a large dataset (10,000+ tweets), **When** processing completes, **Then** I receive a notification with processing summary and can view results.

### User Story 2 - Semantic Search Interface (Priority: P1)

Users can search through processed tweets using natural language queries and find semantically similar tweets based on their embeddings, with results ranked by similarity score.

**Why this priority**: Primary value proposition - users need to discover relevant tweets using semantic understanding rather than exact keyword matching.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by processing a dataset of 100 tweets, then searching for "happy moments" and verifying that tweets with positive sentiment and emotion are returned with appropriate similarity scores.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have processed tweets in the system, **When** I enter a search query like "political discussions", **Then** I see a list of semantically similar tweets ranked by similarity score with highlighting.
2. **Given** I search for tweets, **When** results appear, **Then** I can filter by sentiment (positive/negative/neutral), emotion, or offensiveness level.
3. **Given** I perform a search, **When** I click on a result, **Then** I see detailed analysis including all TweetEval classifications and embedding visualization.

### User Story 3 - Interactive Data Visualization Dashboard (Priority: P2)

Users can explore tweet analysis results through interactive visualizations including sentiment distribution charts, emotion timelines, offensive language trends, and embedding space projections.

**Why this priority**: Enables pattern discovery and insights that would be difficult to glean from raw data or tables alone.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by processing a labeled dataset and verifying that all visualizations render correctly with accurate data representations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have processed tweet data, **When** I visit the dashboard, **Then** I see sentiment distribution pie chart, emotion bar chart, and timeline visualizations.
2. **Given** I'm viewing sentiment analysis, **When** I hover over chart segments, **Then** I see detailed tooltips with counts and percentages.
3. **Given** I want to understand temporal patterns, **When** I select a date range, **Then** all visualizations update to show data for that period.

---

### User Story 4 - Dataset Management & Export (Priority: P2)

Users can manage multiple datasets, view processing status, compare datasets, and export analysis results in various formats (CSV, JSON, PDF reports).

**Why this priority**: Essential for research workflows where users work with multiple datasets and need to export results for further analysis or publication.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading two datasets, processing them, then exporting results and verifying the export files contain all analysis data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have multiple processed datasets, **When** I view the dataset management page, **Then** I see a list with processing status, tweet counts, and last updated timestamps.
2. **Given** I want to export results, **When** I select a dataset and choose CSV export, **Then** I download a file with tweets and all TweetEval classifications.
3. **Given** I need a research report, **When** I generate a PDF report, **Then** I receive a formatted document with charts, statistics, and methodology summary.

---

### User Story 5 - Advanced Analytics & Insights (Priority: P3)

Users can perform advanced analytics including correlation analysis between sentiment and emotion, topic modeling integration, and custom classification model training.

**Why this priority**: Advanced research features that differentiate the platform from basic sentiment analysis tools.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running correlation analysis on a processed dataset and verifying statistical outputs and visualizations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have processed tweet data, **When** I run correlation analysis, **Then** I see statistical relationships between sentiment, emotion, and other variables.
2. **Given** I want to discover topics, **When** I run topic modeling, **Then** I see topic clusters with representative tweets and coherence scores.
3. **Given** I need custom classification, **When** I train a custom model on labeled data, **Then** I can apply it to new tweets and evaluate performance.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when processing fails for individual tweets in a large dataset?
- How does system handle tweets in languages other than English?
- What happens when Qdrant vector database becomes unavailable during processing?
- How does system handle extremely long tweets or tweets with unusual characters?
- What happens when multiple users upload datasets simultaneously?
